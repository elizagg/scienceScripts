The script a.heatmap_byresid.py assigns a B-value to system protein residues representative of clash with ERmanI over a simulation
A modified B-value pdb file (modified_B-factor_byresid.pdb) is made for each glycosite specified in nagResidues.txt and for each simulation replicate specified in simReplicates.txt

1. Modify input files alignerInputs.txt, nagResidues.txt, simReplicates.txt to your system
	python3 a.heatmap_byresid.py alignerInputs.txt nagResidues.txt simReplicates.txt

2. Manually assign a glycan atom a B-value of 100.00 in modified_B-factor_byresid.pdb
	The B-value in modified_B-factor_byresid.pdb represents the percent of simulation time a given residue clashes with ERmanI
	Therefore, the B-values of each protein atom is in the range of 0.00 to 100.00
	Assuming none of the system protein residues clash during 100% of the simulation, assign a glycan atom a B-value of 100.00 so that the 
	color scale in ChimeraX is 0-100 rather than 0-some other number less than 100

3. Visualize heatmap (commands specific to ChimeraX))

Open modified_B-factor_byresid.pdb in ChimeraX and run the following in the command line, 
	1. show #model surface
	2. color byattribute bfactor #model palette white:red key true target s
